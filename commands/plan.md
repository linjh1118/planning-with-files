description: "Start Manus-style file-based planning. Creates docs/task_plan.md, docs/findings.md, docs/progress.md for complex tasks."

Invoke the planning-with-files:planning-with-files skill and follow it exactly as presented to you.

Create the three planning files under the `docs/` directory in the current project if they don't exist:
- docs/task_plan.md — for phases, progress, and decisions
- docs/findings.md — for research and discoveries
- docs/progress.md — for session logging

Then guide the user through the planning workflow.
